# Do-Three-Pointers-Influence-Wins-in-the-NBA

When watching NBA Basketball in this era, we observe teams attempting to play at a very fast pace, and focusing on three types 
of shots specifically and these are:

-Free Throws

-Shots Close to the Basket (Points in the Paint)

-Three Pointers

Of these three, Three Pointers are seen as the most important. Thre Pointers are seen as the most important shot in today's NBA
since a made basket is worth 3 points instead of the traditional 2 point shot. If we make more three pointers, the greater the 
probability that we outscore our opponent and win the game. So I decided to see if this was indeed true. Using data from 
BasketballReference.com, I attempted to see if three pointers cause wins.
